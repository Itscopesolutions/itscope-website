(Photo by Dan DeLong)</figcaption></figure><p>I have been talking a lot this year about <em>democratizing digital</em>. It is about empowering everyone to have a digital experience and enabling everyone to participate in the digital economy. This trend is large-scale, with broad business and social impact. This was clear earlier this month at the Microsoft Government Leaders Summit in Washington, D.C. There, I met with federal agency and department leaders to discuss how cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) are delivering new levels of innovation and impacting entire markets and industries.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/features/feed-the-world-how-the-usda-is-using-data-and-ai-to-address-a-critical-need/"><strong>U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)</strong></a> offers one of the best examples of the power of data and AI to transform agricultural productivity through the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/farmbeats-iot-agriculture/">FarmBeats</a> initiative. By using data from sensors, drones, satellites and tractors, farmers hope to reduce costs, increase yields and grow crops that are more sustainable. The USDA is piloting FarmBeats at its largest research facility &mdash; a 7,000-acre farm in Beltsville, Maryland, with plans to expand the technology to more than 200 farms in the national research network, ranging from small family farms to large commercial operations.</p>
<p>Another example of government innovation is taking place within the <a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/industry-blog/government/2019/10/08/microsoft-takes-to-the-skies-with-uas-program-for-doi/"><strong>Department of the Interior&rsquo;s (DOI)</strong></a> Office of Aviation Services. The DOI is increasing the speed, accuracy and scalability of data captured from over 500 million acres of land from its unmanned aviation systems &mdash; more commonly known as drones. By leveraging Power BI and PowerApps, employees can build tools and custom applications to quickly gain insights from data captured during critical missions (like natural disaster relief).</p>

To support this, we have announced three important partnerships, each aimed at solving pressing challenges facing doctors, researchers and patients. Yesterday we announced our seven-year partnership with <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2019/10/21/humana-and-microsoft-announce-multiyear-strategic-partnership-to-reimagine-health-for-aging-populations-and-their-care-teams/"><strong>Humana</strong></a> to develop predictive solutions for personalized and secure patient support. Using the Microsoft Azure cloud, Azure AI and Microsoft 365, Humana will also be able to equip home health care workers with real-time access to information and voice technology to better understand key factors that influence patient health.</p>
<p>We also announced last week a partnership with health care solutions provider <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2019/10/17/nuance-and-microsoft-partner-to-transform-the-doctor-patient-experience/"><strong>Nuance</strong></a> to transform the doctor-patient experience through the delivery of ambient clinical intelligence technologies (ACI). By using speech-recognition technology and advanced conversational AI with Azure, doctors will have more time to focus on meaningful conversations with their patients. Once a patient gives consent to the ACI system, the clinical documentation writes itself &mdash; all while meeting the security and privacy requirements of this regulated industry.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2019/10/01/bringing-together-deep-bioscience-and-ai-to-help-patients-worldwide-novartis-and-microsoft-work-to-reinvent-treatment-discovery-and-development/"><strong>Novartis</strong></a> will bring Microsoft AI capabilities together with its deep expertise in life sciences to address specific challenges that make the process of discovering, developing and delivering new medicines so costly and time-consuming. Today, it typically takes 10 years and more than $2 billion to develop and bring to market a new prescription drug. Because streamlining this process could save so many lives, our goal is to empower Novartis associates at each step of drug development to use AI to unlock the insights hidden in vast amounts of data, even if they are not data scientists by training.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/allysonkapin/2019/01/28/10-stats-that-build-the-case-for-investing-in-women-led-startups/#5f6cbc7559d5">well-documented</a> that women-led companies deliver higher returns over time than those founded by men, yet female founders&mdash;particularly of enterprise tech startups&mdash;continue to receive significantly less access to capital. In fact, last year companies founded solely by <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/the-vc-female-founders-dashboard">women received only 2.3%</a> of the total capital invested in venture-backed startups. While we&rsquo;re seeing some pockets of progress, we as a VC community can do much more to support and financially back innovation and ideas from women-led companies. But where do we start?</p>
<p>Last year, M12 and our partners set out to expand the path to funding for women entrepreneurs by upending the traditional formula for sourcing potential investments. Through our <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/12/11/announcing-the-female-founders-competition-winners/">first Female Founders Competition</a>, we set the standard VC networks aside and made an open call for the talent to come to us. It worked. We received hundreds of applications and awarded a total of $4 million to two innovative women entrepreneurs: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/greta-cutulenco-29340131/?originalSubdomain=ca">Greta Cutulenco</a>, CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://acerta.ca/">Acerta</a>; and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dorseyjulie/">Julie Dorsey</a>, founder and chief scientist of <a href="https://www.mentalcanvas.com/">Mental Canvas</a>. In the time since, I&rsquo;ve been inspired by how the winners leveraged these investments as springboards to expand their companies and grow their industry footprints.</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s a deeply personal issue &ndash; I share more on the subject in this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.evoke.org/articles/october-2019/fresh-takes/bad-business-leave-women-good-ideas-table-peggy-johnson">Evoke essay</a>. I&rsquo;ve worked with startups for much of my career. I&rsquo;ve seen the obstacles that female founders face just to get a seat at the table. And women like Greta and Julie remind me every day of the incredible opportunity that these underrepresented founders represent &ndash; not just for investors, but for all of us who believe in the power of technology. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m proud to share our commitment to helping continue this progress by casting an even wider net.</p>
<p>As part of this year&rsquo;s competition, we&rsquo;re expanding our geographic reach, adding a new award category and increasing our combined investment with Mayfield and Pivotal Ventures from $4M to $6M. This enables us to award funds to four female-founded companies: two $2M awards for B2B enterprise technology and two additional $1M awards for women-led companies in deeptech, which is another critically underfunded area of opportunity. We&rsquo;re also extending eligibility beyond the United States, Europe, and Israel by accepting applications from India.</p>
<p>I encourage you to watch this video where Pivotal Ventures&rsquo; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/melindagates/">Melinda Gates</a>, Mayfield&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/navinchaddha/">Navin Chaddha</a> and I discuss why we&rsquo;re so passionate about this issue and this competition. I hope you will be inspired, as we are, to find new ways to help create a more equal seat at the table for women founders.</p>

I&rsquo;ve already shared the exciting possibilities in the fields of <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2019/06/19/harnessing-the-power-of-ai-to-transform-healthcare/">healthcare</a> and <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2019/08/07/harnessing-the-power-of-ai-to-transform-agriculture/">agriculture</a> in previous posts. But there may be no area where the possibilities are more interesting &ndash; or more important &ndash; than education and skills. From personalized learning that takes advantage of AI to adapt teaching methods and materials to the needs of individual students, to automated grading that frees teachers from the drudgery of assessing tests so they have more time to work with students, to intelligent systems that are transforming how learners find and interact with information, the opportunities to improve education outcomes and accessibility will be truly transformational.</p>
<p>There are many classrooms around the world where educators teach very diverse groups of students from different cultures, who speak multiple languages. Take <a href="https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/dspss-office365-microsoft-teams-windows10-lebanon">The Dhour Shweir Public Secondary School</a> in Lebanon, for example. It improved the academic interaction between students and educators through applications like OneNote and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/products/teams/default.aspx">Microsoft Teams</a> which provides real-time language translation, allowing students who speak different languages to communicate with one another. The tools not only promote better collaboration and productivity, but also enhanced interaction between the students and their teachers.</p>
<p>We also saw just how much more Teams can do when Australian professor, <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/features/high-tech-for-higher-ed-an-australian-engineering-professor-revamps-student-learning-with-teams/">David Kellermann</a>, recently demonstrated how he created a unique learning experience for his university students &ndash; from a Question bot that can answer students&rsquo; queries on its own to a Power BI dashboard that shows how students&rsquo; exam answers compare to peers&rsquo; and helps build personalized study packs for future tests based on previous performance.</p>
<p>I am intrigued by a new digital assistant that was recently launched by <a href="http://www.staffs.ac.uk/">Staffordshire University</a>, in England. Called Beacon, it is designed to help ease the stress and anxiety that many students experience in their first year at university. Hosted on the Microsoft Azure cloud computing platform, Beacon takes advantage of the fact that students at Staffordshire, one of the UK&rsquo;s leading institutions for digital technologies, are more likely to use their mobile phone to find information or search for help than to talk to a lecturer or seek out a member of the university&rsquo;s staff.</p>
<p>Part information source and part digital coach, Beacon answers questions, suggests activities that students might be interested in, checks on their mood, and supports them in their classwork. If the digital assistant detects signs that a student is struggling, it can send an alert to a university staff member who is able to offer help. By providing insights about how each student is adjusting to university life and creating an avenue for delivering extra support quickly to those who need it, the hope is that it will reduce the dropout rate and help students thrive.</p>
<p>Education doesn&rsquo;t end with school or University. In today&rsquo;s world, we must all be prepared to keep learning and re-skilling, as the world of work evolves.</p>
<p>Outside of traditional education institutes, AI can also help people to reskill or acquire news skills &ndash; for example, through Microsoft&rsquo;s partnership with <a href="https://www.ashoka.org/en-IN">Ashoka</a>, a global organization that supports social entrepreneurs who are committed to finding innovative solutions to society&rsquo;s most pressing social, cultural, and environmental challenges. As part of Microsoft&rsquo;s worldwide Tech for Good Initiative, at the heart of this new partnership is the <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/en-in/features/jean-philippe-courtois-investing-social-entrepreneurship/">Microsoft-Ashoka Accelerator</a>, a program designed to foster an ecosystem of start-ups that take advantage of the power of cloud computing and artificial intelligence to tackle social and environmental issues. I had the pleasure of meeting Arnaud Mourot, Co-Director of Ashoka Europe earlier this year, to talk about support for promising social start-ups. Microsoft is providing access to technology, AI and cloud expertise, and mentors who can help entrepreneurs create intelligent, data-driven solutions, connect to markets, and more.</p>
<p>I also attended the opening of the first Microsoft-Ashoka Accelerators in France and India, where we are piloting the program. Among the early participants in the program are <a href="https://www.singafrance.com/our-presentation">Singa</a>, an organization that helps refugees and asylum seekers connect with people, services, and economic opportunities in their host countries; Ipso Health, which is working to improve healthcare systems and expand access to quality healthcare; and <a href="https://www.librarieswithoutborders.org/">Libraries Without Borders</a>, which sets up libraries and provides access to information resources in conflict zones and areas affected by natural disasters.</p>
<p>One of the things I like most about this new partnership is Ashoka&rsquo;s focus on programs for young people and its understanding of the value that comes from helping a new generation of young entrepreneurs gain the skills, knowledge, and confidence they need to apply advanced technology to social innovation. Through its Youth Ventures program, Ashoka has worked with more than 500,000 young people around the world.</p>
<p>I too, am a strong believer in the value of mentoring young people, and it is something I am actively engaged in through <a href="https://live-for-good.org/en/">Live for Good</a>, a foundation my family and I founded in 2015 to enable young people from all walks of life to reach their full potential through social entrepreneurship and digital innovation.</p>
<p>One of the most important things I have learned is that the world is filled with talented young people who have brilliant ideas and a deep desire to create a better world, but who often lack access to skills training, to technology, or to mentors who can provide the critical guidance they need to truly thrive &ndash; in school and at work. Today, AI-based services like Staffordshire University&rsquo;s Beacon digital assistant and programs like the Microsoft-Ashoka accelerator are providing opportunities for young people to get the support they need to prepare them to lead the way forward, while technologies such as AI are creating new ways to have a positive impact.</p>
<p>To me, this is probably the most inspiring and promising aspect of the digital revolution&mdash;the doors it is opening for all of us to thrive and to create a better world.</p>

From our perspective, there are three aspects to the leadership principle of tech intensity: First, every leader will need to tune their organization to become a fast adopter of best-in- class technology.&nbsp; Second, organizations will need to build their own unique digital capabilities, which starts with workers who are deeply knowledgeable about the latest technology. And finally, leadership in the digital economy will be exponentially amplified by the level of trust that is created with customers, partners, and stakeholders.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s landscape demands a different leadership approach to capitalize on opportunities at the accelerated pace required to deliver modern mission outcomes. In the U.S. federal government, leaders are adopting technology to successfully optimize existing programs and to accelerate new services that improve the lives of American citizens. Many of our government customers are leading by example in building their own tech capabilities, which enable them to be more efficient and be better positioned to deliver on their mission service to their citizens. Examples abound and you&rsquo;ll hear us showcase our partnerships with the Department of Veterans Affairs, USDA Agricultural Research Service, the Department of the Interior and more in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Government is Embracing Tech Intensity </strong></p>
<p>Tech intensity is really an equation &ndash; Tech Intensity = (Tech Adoption X Tech Capability) ^ Trust and as a company Microsoft is focused on providing the inputs to help our customers solve it. For the government agencies harnessing the benefits tech intensity today there are three critical factors to success we&rsquo;re seeing them embrace: First, they&rsquo;re finding ways to increase agility and become fast adopters of best-in-class technology, and equally important, they&rsquo;re building or looking to build their own unique digital capabilities. Don&rsquo;t forget the human factor here which starts with workers who are deeply knowledgeable about the latest technology backed by a culture that encourages capability-building and collaboration to generate new, breakthrough concepts.&nbsp;To speed tech adoption, they recognize how vital it is that they are able to access the latest commercial platforms, tools and training, so that they don&rsquo;t have to re-create technology that already has been commoditized. It&rsquo;s really the first step to building tech intensity. &nbsp;Finally, to assist government leaders in building trust in technology and its deployment to meet Agency missions, Microsoft provides a variety of tools including AI Business School government curriculum (see below) and books like <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/futurecomputed/"><em>The Future Computed</em></a> and <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tools-and-weapons/"><em>Tools and Weapons</em></a> which provide guidance around the impact and ethics of AI which we are seeing government agencies beginning to adopt.</p>
<p><strong>Enabling Government&rsquo;s Tech Intensity Journey</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft is committed to supporting the technology needs of all branches and levels of government and we&rsquo;ve worked with our government customers to achieve the most certifications of any cloud provider. We&rsquo;ve built the most trusted, comprehensive cloud for government which includes <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/clouds/government/">Azure Government</a>, <a href="https://microsoft.com/microsoft-365/government">Microsoft 365 Government</a>, and <a href="https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/">Dynamics 365 Government</a>.

<p>Today we&rsquo;re sharing that we are getting ready to deliver a new form-factor of Data Box Edge, which will be rugged, portable, and battery-operated. The new form-factor will be ruggedized to meet MIL-STD-810G and MIL-STG-461 standards. A single person can carry this appliance in the field, for example, in their backpacks, in remote and disconnected areas.&nbsp; In field operations, speed is of the essence and insights empower decisions. We&rsquo;ve partnered with Klas Telecom to bring you this new form-factor, which will further the intelligence of the forward-deployed operating units, ground patrols, or similar mission needs at the tactical edge and empower faster decision making.</p>

<p><strong>Responsible AI in Government Business School Module</strong></p>
<p>We launched AI Business School because we know AI will be used more and more to help organizations to innovate and solve problems, and we wanted to help leaders be ready to do so in the right way. We recognize that every organization faces its own challenges, and we wanted to provide concrete examples for each of them through tailored information and real-world case studies. That&rsquo;s why we added a <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai-for-business/government-ai-school/?utm_source=ai-blog&amp;utm_campaign=1735">learning path specific to government</a> because of the uniqueness of the problems these agencies face when considering AI applications. <a href="https://aka.ms/AA62v4v">Earlier this week</a>, we rolled out a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-business-school">new version of AI Business School</a>, with updates to that government path, new and adapted lessons within our Responsible AI module and a new learning path for education industry decision makers and educators. The new module focuses on identifying governing practices for responsible AI in government and draws on the wisdom from experts at EY and Altimeter Group. In it we share examples from governments around the world to shed light on what government officials should consider and how to take action. It also has information on tools to support responsible AI and how to make AI governance both tangible and measurable</p>

For a new compound to make it from initial discovery through development, testing and clinical trials to finally earn regulatory approval can take a decade or more. Nine out of 10 promising drug candidates fail somewhere along the way. As a result, on average, it costs life sciences companies $2.6 billion to introduce a single new prescription drug.</p>
<p>This is much more than just a challenge for life sciences companies. Streamlining drug development is an urgent issue for human health more broadly. From uncovering new ways to treat age-old sicknesses like malaria that still kills hundreds of thousands of people every year, to finding new cancer treatments, or developing new vaccines to prevent highly-contagious diseases from turning into global pandemics, the impact in terms of lives saved worldwide would be enormous if we could make inventing new medicines faster.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.novartis.com/news/media-releases/novartis-and-microsoft-announce-collaboration-transform-medicine-artificial-intelligence">As announced today</a>, this is why Novartis and Microsoft are collaborating to explore how to take advantage of advanced Microsoft AI technology combined with Novartis&rsquo; deep life sciences expertise to find new ways to address the challenges underlying every phase of drug development &ndash; including research, clinical trials, manufacturing, operations and finance. In a recent interview, Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan spoke about the potential for this alliance to unlock the power of AI to help Novartis accelerate research into new treatments for many of the thousands of diseases for which there is, as yet, no known cure.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xh7iioCd-yU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>In the biotech industry, there have been amazing scientific advances in recent years that have the potential to revolutionize the discovery of new, life-saving drugs. Because many of these advances are based on the ability to analyze huge amounts of data in new ways, developing new drugs has become as much an AI and data science problem as it is a biology and chemistry problem. This means companies like Novartis need to become data science companies to an extent never seen before. Central to our work together is a focus on empowering Novartis associates at each step of drug development to use AI to unlock the insights hidden in vast amounts of data, even if they aren&rsquo;t data scientists. That&rsquo;s because while the exponential increase in digital health information in recent years offers new opportunities to improve human health, making sense of all the data is a huge challenge.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oo1Ye2BBh8w" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The issue isn&rsquo;t just a problem of the overwhelming volume. Much of the information exists in the form of unstructured data, such as research lab notes, medical journal articles, and clinical trial results, all of which is typically stored in disconnected systems. This makes bringing all that data together extremely difficult. Our two companies have a dream. We want all Novartis associates &ndash; even those without special expertise in data science &ndash; to be able to use Microsoft AI solutions every day, to analyze large amounts of information and discover new correlations and patterns critical to finding new medicines. The goal of this strategic collaboration is to make this dream a reality. This offers the potential to empower everyone from researchers exploring the potential of new compounds and scientists figuring out dosage levels, to clinical trial experts measuring results, operations managers seeking to improve supply chains more efficiently, and even business teams looking to make more effective decisions. And as associates work on new problems and develop new AI models, they will continually build on each other&rsquo;s work, creating a virtuous cycle of exploration and discovery. The result? Pervasive intelligence that spans the company and reaches across the entire drug discovery process, improving Novartis&rsquo; ability to find answers to some of the world&rsquo;s most pressing health challenges.</p>
<p>As part of our work with Novartis, data scientists from Microsoft Research and research teams from Novartis will also work together to investigate how AI can help unlock transformational new approaches in three specific areas. The first is about personalized treatment for macular degeneration &ndash; a leading cause of irreversible blindness. The second will involve exploring ways to use AI to make manufacturing new gene and cell therapies more efficient, with an initial focus on acute lymphoblastic leukemia. And the third area will focus on using AI to shorten the time required to design new medicines, using pioneering neural networks developed by Microsoft to automatically generate, screen and select promising molecules. As our work together moves forward, we expect that the scope of our joint research will grow.</p>
<p>At Microsoft, we&rsquo;re excited about the potential for this collaboration to transform R&amp;D in life sciences. As Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella explained, putting the power of AI in the hands of Novartis employees will give the company unprecedented opportunities to explore new frontiers of medicine that will yield new life-saving treatments for patients around the world.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wMfsQE-D2q4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>While we&rsquo;re just at the beginning of a long process of exploration and discovery, this strategic alliance marks the start of an important collaborative effort that promises to have a profound impact on how breakthrough medicines and treatments are developed and delivered. With the depth and breadth of knowledge that Novartis offers in bioscience and Microsoft&rsquo;s unmatched expertise in computer science and AI, we have a unique opportunity to reinvent the way new medicines are created. Through this process, we believe we can help lead the way forward toward a world where high-quality treatment and care is significantly more personal, more effective, more affordable and more accessible.</p></div>";s:6:"author";O:16:"SimplePie_Author":3:{s:4:"name";s:9:"Peter Lee";s:4:"link";N;s:5:"email";N;}s:8:"category";s:65:"Featured|Recent News|AI|life sciences|Microsoft Research|Novartis";s:4:"date";s:19:"2019-10-01 14:04:04";s:10:"enclosures";a:1:{i:0;O:19:"SimplePie_Enclosure":27:{s:7:"bitrate";N;s:8:"captions";N;s:10:"categories";N;s:8:"channels";N;s:9:"copyright";N;s:7:"credits";N;s:11:"description";N;s:8:"duration";N;s:10:"expression";N;s:9:"framerate";N;s:7:"handler";N;s:6:"hashes";N;s:6:"height";N;s:10:"javascript";N;s:8:"keywords";N;s:4:"lang";N;s:6:"length";N;s:4:"link";N;s:6:"medium";N;s:6:"player";N;s:7:"ratings";N;s:12:"restrictions";a:1:{i:0;O:21:"SimplePie_Restriction":3:{s:12:"relationship";s:5:"allow";s:4:"type";N;s:5:"value";s:7:"default";}}s:12:"samplingrate";N;s:10:"thumbnails";N;s:5:"title";N;s:4:"type";N;s:5:"width";N;}}}i:9;O:8:"stdClass":8:{s:5:"title";s:45:"Empowering financial services to achieve more";s:4:"link";s:90:"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2019/09/23/empowering-financial-services-to-achieve-more/";s:11:"description";s:501:"<div>It&rsquo;s a transformative time for the financial services industry.

In the fast-changing, tech-driven world banks now live in,&nbsp;they recognize&nbsp;that technology can play a role in helping them meet both&nbsp;their customers&rsquo; expectations&nbsp;and challenging&nbsp;regulatory requirements. Coming to Microsoft from that world myself just two weeks ago, I&rsquo;m now leading the team responsible for&nbsp;helping our&nbsp;customers&nbsp;do just that&nbsp;&ndash; regardless of where they are in their&nbsp;transformation journey.</p>
<p>After 20 years in financial services, I&rsquo;ve seen the impact technology can have, and recognize we have been approaching an inflection point for some time &ndash; and are at the tipping point.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re approaching the close of a decade, and the industry has a tremendous opportunity to accelerate use of cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) as a catalyst to improve competitiveness, drive growth, elevate customer experiences and keep ahead of changing regulations and cybersecurity threats.</p>
<p>To take full advantage of what&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sibos.com/about/sibos-2019-london">Sibos 2019</a>&nbsp;describes as a hyper-connected world, more banks are making broader cloud platform choices &ndash; moving beyond infrastructure services &ndash; and extending their cloud investment to productivity, data and AI, and agile customer relationship management services.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re making this platform decision to seize the opportunity at hand and evolve to meet the rapidly changing needs and expectations of customers. They recognize technology can help them create the new business models required &ndash; even integrate past, present and future.</p>
<p>As we look ahead, key to this will be the ability&nbsp;for&nbsp;financial organizations to:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Deliver differentiated &#8203;customer experience</strong>&#8203; by accelerating growth and loyalty through deeper customer insights and&nbsp;relationships &#8203;</li>
<li><strong>Modernize payments and core banking</strong>&#8203; with agility to roll out new products and services&#8203;</li>
<li><strong>Manage risk across the organization</strong>&#8203; with deep insights and compliance with regulatory requirements&#8203;</li>
<li><strong>Empower employees</strong>&#8203;&nbsp;<strong>through teamwork</strong>&#8203; and improved employee productivity and accelerate workplace modernization&#8203;</li>
<li><strong>Combat financial crime</strong>&#8203; by protecting your bank and customers while lowering compliance costs&#8203;</li>
</ul><p>Because of the&nbsp;hyper-connectivity, we know that regulatory compliance is and must be a top priority, which is why Microsoft continues to work with financial services regulators and customers to ensure our cloud services help customers meet their strict regulatory requirements. Our&nbsp;team has&nbsp;been a part of the consultation period in sharing perspectives on updated outsourcing guidance by the&nbsp;<a href="https://news.microsoft.com/transform/supporting-modern-technology-policy-for-the-financial-services-industry/">European Banking Authority (&ldquo;EBA)&rdquo; and the final&nbsp;issued&nbsp;guidance</a>,&nbsp;which takes effect on Sept.&nbsp;30, 2019.&#8239; This longstanding engagement with regulators&nbsp;around cloud&nbsp;computing&nbsp;is one of the reasons&nbsp;more than 90&nbsp;percent&nbsp;of Global Systemically Important Financial Institutions (&ldquo;GSIFIs&rdquo;)&nbsp;depend on&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;cloud&nbsp;services. As a company we&rsquo;ve&nbsp;made the investments and commitments to ensure they can meet their regulatory obligations.</p>
<p>To&nbsp;accelerate&nbsp;digital transformation, Microsoft has focused on removing barriers to adopting&nbsp;cloud&nbsp;technology&nbsp;&ndash; such as regulatory and compliance, and beyond. At Sibos, we&rsquo;re unveiling several announcements&nbsp;to&nbsp;further&nbsp;underscore&nbsp;this effort:</p>

Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection is designed to benefit merchants and banks while also improving customer shopping experiences by providing a seamless purchasing experience. The solution combats payment and account-creation fraud with AI&nbsp;technology that continuously learns and adapts to evolving fraudulent patterns. When generally available, the service will include a new feature (<em>Transaction Acceptance Booster</em>) that addresses wrongful declines &ndash; a common issue negatively impacting&nbsp;both merchants and banks.&nbsp;Among the first to deploy the new solution is&nbsp;<a href="https://wiproconsumercare.com/">Wipro Consumer Care &amp; Lighting Group</a>&nbsp;in India to reduce the fraud rate for their ecommerce platform&nbsp;<a href="https://yardleyoflondon.com/">Yardley.com</a>.

BIAN is a not-for-profit association to establish and promote a common architectural framework for enabling banking interoperability.

The&nbsp;assessment was conducted using&nbsp;TruSight&rsquo;s&nbsp;stringent best-practices assessment methodology. The new&nbsp;TruSight&nbsp;report gives financial services organizations a high-quality assessment of Microsoft&rsquo;s cloud services based on standardized, industry-designed control assessment methodology.&nbsp;TruSight&nbsp;and its third-party assessment utility was created by leading banking institutions for the collective benefit of all financial services participants. The utility gives financial institutions the ability to access assessments on the most widely used third&nbsp;parties across financial services, rather than having to individually conduct assessments. Microsoft is the first of the major cloud providers to complete the assessment, which covered 27 control domains such as information technology, cybersecurity, business resiliency, privacy, physical security and risk management.&nbsp;Visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://aka.ms/TruSight-Compliance">Microsoft Trust Center</a>&nbsp;to learn more.</li>
